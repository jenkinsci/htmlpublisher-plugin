    If checked, scripts will be permitted to use <code>eval()</code> and similar methods
    for dynamic code generation. This could make Jenkins vulnerable to cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks if the HTML content is not from a trusted source. <b>Only enable this option
    if you trust the source of the HTML files.</b>
